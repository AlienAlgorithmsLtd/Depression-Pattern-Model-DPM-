📘 Depression Pattern Model (DPM)
The Depression Pattern Model (DPM) is a practical, self-mapping framework developed by Alien Algorithms Ltd® to help individuals identify and navigate depressive episodes through structured pattern recognition.

Rather than focusing on static diagnoses or generalized symptom checklists, DPM encourages users to actively document their daily mental states, emotional fluctuations, triggers, and environmental conditions. Over time, these entries build into a pattern profile that makes the invisible visible — giving users a clearer sense of when, how, and why depression cycles manifest.

🧠 Why It Matters
Depression rarely follows a predictable script. Its symptoms can shift subtly, hide behind routine, or appear suddenly in response to long-suppressed stimuli. The DPM empowers users to reclaim insight by:

Logging daily emotional states using consistent, minimal-effort prompts

Tracking environmental, nutritional, or social variables

Identifying patterns of descent, stagnation, and recovery

Comparing weeks over time to reveal invisible rhythms or cycles

🔄 Part of the Self-Mapping Suite
The DPM works in tandem with other models in the Alien Algorithms self-mapping series:

Anxiety Mapping Model (AMM): A frequency-based model for identifying dominant anxiety types by tracking the most frequent symptoms over time.

PTSD Response Map (PRM): A trauma response framework that reveals recurring triggers and subconscious protective patterns, helping users understand how their nervous system adapts to past events.

Together, these models provide a multi-layered diagnostic toolkit for personal insight and pattern recognition — all non-clinical, open-source, and self-directed.

✍️ Who It’s For
Individuals managing depression independently or alongside professional care

Mental health researchers seeking non-invasive data patterning frameworks

Clinicians offering structured self-reflection tools to patients

Anyone seeking to decode their internal patterns with visual clarity
