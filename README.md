🌀 Depression Pattern Model (DPM)

The Depression Pattern Model (DPM) is a non-clinical mapping framework developed by Alien Algorithms Ltd® that decodes depressive states by examining rhythmic and cyclical patterns rather than symptoms in isolation.

DPM treats depressive episodes as energy-wave systems — patterns that rise, fall, repeat, and alternate based on internal survival logic.

This model allows individuals to trace cycles and understand when, why, and how depressive states emerge.

🧬 Core Concept

DPM focuses on rhythm:

Depression follows cycles, not randomness.

These cycles form predictable patterns:

slow declines

sudden collapses

flatlines

delayed emotional rebounds

periodic shutdowns

wave-like recovery

By mapping these waves, DPM reveals the structure behind emotional downturns.

🔍 What DPM Maps

Energy shifts across days or weeks

Behavioral withdrawal phases

Cognitive fog cycles

Emotional flattening vs emotional surge points

Collapse states

Rebound periods (“the emotional echo”)

The goal is understanding — not diagnosis.

🔄 Relationship to AMM & PRM

DPM is one pillar of the Self-Mapping Suite, alongside:

🔗 Anxiety Mapping Model (AMM)

https://github.com/AlienAlgorithmsLtd/Anxiety-Mapping-Model-AMM

🔗 PTSD Response Map (PRM)

https://github.com/AlienAlgorithmsLtd/PTSD-Response-Map-PRM-

Together, these three models map:

Anxiety patterns (AMM: frequency)

Trauma cycles (PRM: stage architecture)

Depressive rhythms (DPM: wave patterns)

This interconnected system helps users understand the hidden logic of their internal states.

👥 Who DPM Is For

People experiencing recurring depressive cycles

Anyone wanting clarity without reliving painful material

Support workers needing pattern-based tools

Researchers studying emotional rhythm mapping

DPM transforms depressive experiences into something observable and understandable.
