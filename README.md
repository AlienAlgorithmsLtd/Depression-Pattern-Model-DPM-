The Depression Pattern Model (DPM) is a self-directed mapping framework that helps individuals observe and understand depressive states through structured pattern recognition. Instead of framing depression as a fixed identity, DPM reveals it as a recurring internal system made of emotional, cognitive, physical, and behavioural signals that shift in predictable ways over time.

DPM is non-clinical, open-source, and accessible, offering a clear way for individuals to see patterns that are usually invisible during depressive cycles.

💡 What DPM Is

DPM helps users map:

Emotional heaviness, numbness, guilt, hopelessness

Cognitive rumination, fog, shutdown, slowed processing

Physical fatigue, heaviness, depletion

Behavioural withdrawal, avoidance, disrupted routines

Cycles of descent, stagnation, and recovery

Trigger pathways that influence depressive shifts

Long-term trends in intensity and frequency

By converting depressive episodes into observable data, DPM gives individuals a clearer sense of when, how, and why their cycles repeat.

🔍 Core Elements

The DPM framework explores:

The four domains of depressive experience

Baseline depressive tones

High-intensity spikes or crashes

Recurring loops reinforcing depressive states

Trigger → response → consequence patterns

Multi-week rhythms and cycles

Strategy experimentation to reduce intensity or duration

DPM does not attempt to diagnose or treat — it reveals structure, which empowers the individual to navigate their own internal landscape.

🧠 Why DPM Helps

Depression often feels formless and unpredictable.
DPM counteracts that by:

Making symptoms visible

Revealing hidden rhythms

Identifying repeated triggers

Highlighting behavioural loops

Showing gradual improvements

Providing language to describe internal states

What feels chaotic becomes understandable.

🔁 Integration With the Anxiety Mapping Model (AMM)

DPM works naturally with the Anxiety Mapping Model (AMM).
Where AMM maps activation patterns, DPM maps shutdown patterns.

Together, the two models provide a complete self-understanding system.
